# Qubit Ink @qubitink

Quantum-inspired generative art in one Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains organized cells for each image and will evolve over time; re-run a cell to regenerate its figure.

## Requirements

Python 3.9+, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow. Optional: Qiskit (circuit panel), ffmpeg or imageio-ffmpeg for video.

## Use

Open the notebook, run cells from top to bottom. Each cell saves PNG (and some SVG) outputs beside the notebook.

## License

MIT.
